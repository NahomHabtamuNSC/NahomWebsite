				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Geography:</b>

					.Ethiopia is a landlocked country in East Africa, bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest.
					It is the second-most populous country in Africa, after Nigeria, with a population exceeding 115 million people as of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021.
					Ethiopia's diverse geography includes highlands, plateaus, valleys, and lowlands. The Ethiopian Highlands are a prominent feature, and they include some of the highest peaks in Africa.

					<p><b>History:</b>
					
					.Ethiopia is one of the world's oldest independent nations, with a history dating back thousands of years. It is known for its ancient civilization, including the Kingdom of Axum, which was a major trading power in the Red Sea region.
					Ethiopia is unique in that it has never been fully colonized by a European power. It successfully resisted Italian attempts at colonization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, earning it the nickname "Africa's Unconquered." It briefly became an Italian colony from 1936 to 1941 during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.
					Ethiopia is traditionally associated with the biblical account of the Queen of Sheba and her visit to King Solomon in Jerusalem. It is also believed to be the home of the Ark of the Covenant, which is said to be housed in the Church of St. Mary of Zion in Axum.</p>
					Culture:
					
					.Ethiopia is known for its diverse culture and rich heritage. It has over 80 distinct ethnic groups, each with its own language and traditions. Amharic is the official language, but there are many other languages spoken throughout the country.
					The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is the dominant religion in the country, and its practices and traditions have had a significant influence on Ethiopian culture and art.
					Ethiopian cuisine is famous for dishes like injera (a sourdough flatbread) and doro wat (a spicy chicken stew). Coffee, which originated in Ethiopia, is an integral part of the culture, and traditional coffee ceremonies are common.

					<p><b>Economy:</b>
					
					.Ethiopia's economy has been predominantly agrarian, with agriculture employing the majority of the population. Key crops include coffee, teff (a type of grain), and various vegetables.
					In recent years, Ethiopia has experienced significant economic growth and development, with the government focusing on industrialization, infrastructure development, and attracting foreign investment.
					The country is also known for its unique calendar, which is about seven to eight years behind the Gregorian calendar. The Ethiopian New Year, known as Enkutatash, is celebrated in September.
					Challenges:
					
					.Ethiopia has faced various challenges, including political instability, ethnic tensions, and conflicts. As of my last update in September 2021, the country was dealing with a conflict in the Tigray region, which had resulted in humanitarian crises and displacement of people.
					Poverty and access to basic services, such as healthcare and education, remain significant challenges in many parts of the country.
					Please note that the situation in Ethiopia may have evolved since my last update in September 2021, so it's advisable to refer to more recent sources for the latest information about the country.</p>
