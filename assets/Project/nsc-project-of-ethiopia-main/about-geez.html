				<h2>Geez Language</h2>
				<p><b>1. Historical Significance:</b>

					Geez is one of the oldest written languages in the world and has been used in the Horn of Africa for over 2,000 years.
					It was the language of the Kingdom of Aksum (Axum), one of the great civilizations of antiquity that existed in what is now modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. Aksum was a major trading power and adopted Christianity early on, making Geez the language of early Ethiopian Christianity.
					<b>2. Writing System:</b>
					
					Geez is written in its own unique script, also known as the Ge'ez script or Ethiopic script. It is an abugida, similar to other scripts in the Semitic family.
					The Ge'ez script consists of characters that represent consonants, with inherent vowel sounds that can be modified using diacritics to indicate different vowels.
					It has been used historically for religious texts, historical records, and inscriptions.</p>

					<p><b>3. Liturgical Language:</b>
					
					Geez is primarily known as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. It is used for religious texts, prayers, and rituals.
					Many of the important religious texts, including the Bible, are preserved in Geez. The Ethiopian version of the Bible, known as the "Ge'ez Bible" or the "Ethiopic Bible," contains several books not found in other Christian canons.</p>

					<p><b>4. Decline in Everyday Use:</b>
					
					While Geez remains important for religious purposes, it is no longer widely spoken as a native or everyday language. Over time, it has evolved into modern languages like Amharic and Tigrinya, which are spoken by the majority of Ethiopians and Eritreans, respectively.
					Geez declined as a spoken language because of linguistic evolution and the emergence of these modern languages, which incorporated Geez vocabulary and structures.</p>

					<p><b>5. Preservation and Revival:</b>
					
					Despite its decline in everyday use, Geez is still studied and preserved by scholars, linguists, and religious institutions. There are efforts to ensure its survival and study its historical texts.
					In Ethiopia, there has been a resurgence of interest in Geez, particularly among academics and those interested in Ethiopian history and culture.</p>

					<p><b>6. Influence on Modern Languages:</b>
					
					Geez has left a significant mark on the modern Ethiopian and Eritrean languages, including Amharic and Tigrinya. These languages have borrowed heavily from Geez in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and script.
					Many loanwords from Geez are found in everyday vocabulary, especially in religious, academic, and cultural contexts.</p>
